## Project Description

Develop, in a team of up to 3 people, a personal website consisting of a home page (`index.html`) about the team members and a portfolio page (`portfolio.html`) showcasing their projects and interests. The site must be visually appealing, organized, and easy to navigate, implementing navigation between pages and applying HTML and CSS concepts taught.

### Requirements

1. **Basic Structure and Semantic Tags (2 points):**
   - Create the HTML structure with semantic tags (`header`, `main`, `footer`) for the home and portfolio pages.
   - The pages must be valid in the W3C validator (https://validator.w3.org/).

2. **Content and Links (2 points):**
   - Use headings and paragraphs to introduce sections on both pages, including descriptions of projects or skills on the portfolio page.
   - Add links between the two pages, as well as relevant internal and external links.
   - Ensure intuitive navigation between pages using menu links, buttons, or navigation bars styled with CSS.

3. **Styling, Positioning, and Margins (2 points):**
   - Define global styles in an external CSS file to ensure visual consistency.
   - Use CSS for positioning and margins, ensuring a visually pleasing and well-organized layout.

4. **Text Formatting (1 point):**
   - Choose and apply appropriate fonts for headings, subheadings, and paragraphs.
   - Adjust font size and weight (bold) to ensure readability and visual hierarchy.
   - Use text styles (italic, underline) and spacing (line-height, margin) to improve readability and content organization.

5. **Forms (1 point):**
   - Add a form on one of the pages for collecting information or feedback.
   - Also, add a search form for YouTube videos.

6. **Images (1 point):**
   - Use images to illustrate projects or skills on the portfolio page, adjusting them with CSS.
   - Use lower resolution images that, when clicked, lead to larger images.

7. **Hosting (1 point):**
   - Research and make the site available on GitHub Pages.

### Submission

One team member must submit the site link as a response to the activity on Google Classroom by the due date. The page must contain the names of the team members.
